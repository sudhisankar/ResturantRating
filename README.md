# 🍽️ Restaurant Rating Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project is a Machine Learning-based model to predict restaurant ratings using features like location, cuisines, cost, and online delivery options. The project was built using Python and Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab).

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains restaurant-related information such as:
- Restaurant name
- Location
- Cuisines
- Approximate cost for two people
- Online delivery availability
- Type of restaurant
- Rating

## 🧠 Model & Approach

The following steps were performed:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing distribution of ratings, types, and cost
3. **Model Building**
   - Trained multiple models including:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Tree Regressor
     - Random Forest Regressor
   - Evaluated models using R² score and Mean Absolute Error

## 🧪 Results

The model with the best performance was selected based on:
- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Error

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install the required libraries (optional):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open `RestaurantRating.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
4. Run the cells in order.
